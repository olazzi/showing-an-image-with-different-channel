# showing-an-image-with-different-channel - using cv2 library
This project involves analyzing an RGB image by displaying its individual R, G, and B color channels. This information can be used to determine the intensity of each color and how they interact with each other. Additionally, the image can be converted into the HSV color space to display its Hue, Saturation, and Value channels, which provide a different way of analyzing the colors present in the image. Finally, the image can be converted into the Lab color space to display its L, a, and b channels, which are used to represent color information in a way that is more perceptually uniform than the RGB color space. Overall, this project provides an opportunity to explore different color spaces and how they can be used to analyze and manipulate images.
